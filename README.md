# Pymaceuticals - Three Key Trends

o When comparing the four drugs of 1)Capomulin, 2)Infubinol, 3)Ketapril and 4)Placebo, the Capomulin was the only effective drug for the tumor. When taking the Infubinol and Ketapril, the volume of the tumor grew at a similar rate with the Placebo. 
 - More specifically, the volume of the tumor decreased by 19% when taking the Capomulin over 45 days.
 - However, taking the Infubinol resulted in the tumor volume increase of 46%, and taking the Ketapril resulted in a 57% increase, which is worse than taking the Placebo. 

o Taking the Capomulin was not only useful in reducing the tumor volume, but also improving the survival rate. After 45 days of treatment, more than 80% of mice survived when taking the Capomulin while other drugs showed less than 50% of survival rates. 

o When it comes to 'Metastatic Spread During Treatment,' all drugs resulted in the metastatic sites increase. However, the spread of the Capomulin was the slowest, whereas the Ketapril and the Placebo showed the fastest increases. 

# Pyber - Three Key Trends

o When comparing urban cities with suburban and rural ones,  urban cities have much more drivers, a bigger number of rides (per city) and lower average fares. Rural cities tend to have a smaller number of drivers and rides and much higher fares. 

o While urban cities have 80.9% of total drivers, they get 68.4% of total rides and 62.7% of total fares. 

o On the contrary, rural cities have only 2.6% of drivers, but they take 5.3% of total rides and 6.8% of total fares.
